Description: Estimates the best normalizing 
    transformation for a vector consistently and accurately. It implements 
    the Box-Cox transformation, the Johnson transformation, three types 
    of Lambert transformations, and the ordered quantile normalization 
    transformation. It also estimates the normalization efficacy of other
    commonly used transformations along with the basic transformations such as Log, 
    Square, Cube, etc. It selects the best possible transformation based on the 
    user specified metrics chosen from Min Skewness, Shapiro P Value and Pearson P Value.
